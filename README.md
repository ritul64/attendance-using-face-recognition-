# attendance-using-face-recognition-
The Face Recognition-Based Attendance System is a real-time application designed to automate attendance marking using advanced face recognition technology. Leveraging OpenCV and Haar cascades, the system efficiently detects and recognizes faces from a live webcam feed. It features an intuitive interface that allows users to manage attendance seamlessly and export records in CSV format for easy accessibility and analysis. This project showcases my ability to integrate computer vision techniques with practical solutions, demonstrating expertise in Python and OpenCV while addressing real-world needs for automation and accuracy.
